# Vector Search with ChromaDB

This notebook demonstrates how to use **ChromaDB**, a modern vector database, for storing and querying high-dimensional embeddings. The project showcases how semantic similarity search can be used with a small sample of product descriptions.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- ChromaDB
- Jupyter Notebook
- Vector Embeddings

## 📁 Dataset
The data used is a set of mock product/service descriptions, ideal for demonstrating basic vector search capabilities.

## 🧠 Topics Covered
- What are vector databases?
- When and why to use them
- Overview of ChromaDB
- Creating an in-memory vector database
- Adding documents and performing similarity queries

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Run all cells — the notebook installs ChromaDB and walks through all key steps

## 📌 Use Cases for Vector Databases
- LLM-powered retrieval (RAG for chatbots)
- Document semantic search
- Image/video similarity
- Personalized recommendations
