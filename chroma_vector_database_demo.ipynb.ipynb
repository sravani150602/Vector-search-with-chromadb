        "\n",
        "### ○ Explain what kind of datastore vector databases are.  \n",
        "Vector databases are specialized datastores designed to store, manage, and query high-dimensional vectors — numerical representations of data such as text, images, audio, or video.  \n",
        "Unlike traditional relational databases that use structured rows and columns, vector databases focus on **similarity-based search** using vector embeddings, often powered by Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) algorithms like HNSW or FAISS.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### ○ Why/when would you use them?  \n",
        "Vector databases are used when you need to retrieve information based on **semantic similarity**, not exact matches.  \n",
        "**Common use cases include:**\n",
        "- Semantic search (e.g., document or FAQ retrieval)\n",
        "- Chatbots and LLMs (e.g., Retrieval-Augmented Generation)\n",
        "- Image and video similarity search\n",
        "- Personalized recommendations\n",
        "- Fraud detection and anomaly detection in high-dimensional data\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### ○ What is Chroma?  \n",
        "**Chroma** is an open-source vector database built for simplicity and ease of use, especially in AI/ML workflows.  \n",
        "**Key features:**\n",
        "- Python-native API\n",
        "- Lightweight and easy to integrate with embedding models\n",
        "- Ideal for small to medium-sized projects\n",
